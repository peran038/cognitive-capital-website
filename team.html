                    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                        Dr. Evelyn Reed is the Founder and Managing Partner of Cognitive Capital. She brings a rare, dual perspective to deep technology investing, combining a rigorous, first-principles background in artificial intelligence research with a two-decade track record of successful venture capital investing. Her career has been defined by a singular focus: identifying and nurturing the foundational technologies that create new markets and redefine existing ones.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                        Evelyn's journey into technology began at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where she earned her PhD in Computational Neuroscience. Her research focused on developing novel neural network architectures inspired by the human brain's ability to learn from sparse, incomplete data. This work, which was published in several leading academic journals, provided her with a deep, technical understanding of the principles of intelligence, both biological and artificial. Following her PhD, she joined a major technology research lab as a lead AI researcher, where she was instrumental in developing some of the earliest large-scale machine learning systems for real-world applications.
                    </p>
                     <p class="text-gray-400 mb-4">
                        Transitioning to venture capital 20 years ago, Evelyn quickly established a reputation for her ability to look beyond surface-level trends and perform deep, technical diligence. She has led early-stage investments in multiple category-defining companies in enterprise software, semiconductors, and applied AI, resulting in several multi-billion dollar exits.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-gray-400">
                        Her investment philosophy, which forms the bedrock of Cognitive Capital, is rooted in her research background. She believes that true, defensible value in the technology sector is not built on clever applications, but on foundational platforms with deep, structural moatsâ€”proprietary data, novel algorithms, and full-stack integration. It is this thesis-driven, analytical approach that allows Cognitive Capital to identify the generational companies that are not just participating in the AI revolution, but are architecting its very foundations.
